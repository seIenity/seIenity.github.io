<h1>Welcome to selenity's Programming Portfolio</h1>

My name is <strong>Selena Cabral.</strong> <br> 
I am a Computer Science major at URI. This is my website for CSC 106 where I will have my code. So far, the code I have <br>
written for this website is all in HTML. On the About Me page, you are free to check out a little about myself. This information <br> is subject to change along the way. The Javascripts page will show my code as the semester continues. Enjoy and happy <br> programming!
